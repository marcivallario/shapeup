# Shape Up

Shape Up is a workout generator where users can randomly generate and save exercises for a complete full body workout.

## Motivation
The inspiration for Shapeup came during the COVID-19 pandemic when the world was suddenly confined to their homes. Without the weekly trips to the gym, many people looked at digital options to continue to stay healthy. But with the overwhelming amount of options, it's easy to get lost in what to do. Shape Up simplifies that for you by randomly creating full body workouts targeting each major muscle group, complete with video demostrations.
